title: Litellm
---
[Litellm](https://www.litellm.ai/) is a great solution to call all LLM APIs using the OpenAI format [Bedrock, Huggingface, VertexAI, TogetherAI, Azure, OpenAI, Groq etc.]

### How will this help?

Using Litellm you can configure any [supported model](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers) to use the OpenAI format.

In this tutorial we will walk you through running evaluations on UpTrain using Litellm.

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have an instance of Litellm already setup and running. Follow the [documentation](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/) to get started.

3. You will require:
    - API base (Eg: `http://0.0.0.0:4000/chat/completions`)
    - Model name (Eg: `llama-3`)
    - API key: (Eg: `sk-1234`)

### How to integrate?
**First, let's import the necessary packages**

```python
pip install uptrain
```

```python
from uptrain import EvalLLM, Evals, Settings
import json
```

**Create your data**

You can define your data as a simple dictionary with the following keys:

- `question`: The question you want to ask
- `context`: The context relevant to the question
- `response`: The response to the question

```python
data = [
   {
        'question': 'What is the capital of France?',
        'context': 'France, context for its exquisite pastries and fashion, has a capital city called Paris. It\'s a place where people speak French and enjoy baguettes. I once heard that the Eiffel Tower was built by aliens, but don\'t quote me on that.',
        'response': 'The capital of France is Paris.'
    }
]
```

**Define the model**

We will be using Llama-3 for this example.


```python
settings = Settings(
    model="llama-3",                      # change this according to your setup
    custom_llm_provider="litellm",
    api_base="http://0.0.0.0:4000",       # change this according to your setup
    api_key="sk-1234",                    # change this according to your setup
    uptrain_local_url="http://ip:port",   # (optional) you may require this if not running uptrain on a local machine
)
 
```

**Create an EvalLLM Evaluator**

Before we can start using UpTrain, we need to create an EvalLLM Evaluator.

```python
eval_llm = EvalLLM(settings)
```

We have used the following 3 metrics from UpTrain's library:

1. [Context Relevance](/predefined-evaluations/context-awareness/context-relevance): Evaluates how relevant the retrieved context is to the question specified.

2. [Response Conciseness](/predefined-evaluations/response-quality/response-conciseness): Evaluates how concise the generated response is or if it has any additional irrelevant information for the question asked..

3. [Response Relevance](/predefined-evaluations/response-quality/response-relevance): Evaluates how relevant the generated response was to the question specified.

You can look at the complete list of UpTrain's supported metrics [here](https://docs.uptrain.ai/predefined-evaluations/overview)

**Evaluate your data and view the response**
```python
results = eval_llm.evaluate(
    project_name = 'Litellm-tutorial',
    data=data,
    checks=[Evals.CONTEXT_RELEVANCE, Evals.RESPONSE_CONCISENESS, Evals.RESPONSE_RELEVANCE]
)
print(results)
```
Sample Reponse:
```json

                 "a capital city called Paris. It's a place where people speak "
